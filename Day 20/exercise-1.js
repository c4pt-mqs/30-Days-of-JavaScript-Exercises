// // Writing Clean Codes

// Use meaningful variable and function names: Use descriptive and meaningful names for your variables and functions that accurately describe what they do. Avoid using single-letter variable names or obscure function names.

// Keep your code organized: Use proper indentation, spacing, and line breaks to make your code easy to read and follow. Use comments to explain complex logic and add context to your code.

// Don't repeat yourself: Avoid repeating code blocks by creating reusable functions or objects. This makes your code more concise and easier to maintain.

// Use consistent code formatting: Consistent formatting makes it easier for others to read and understand your code. Use tools like ESLint to enforce consistent code formatting.

// Use modern language features: Take advantage of modern JavaScript language features to make your code more concise and readable. For example, use arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals.

// Write modular code: Use modular design patterns to break your code into smaller, more manageable pieces. This makes it easier to test, maintain, and refactor your code.

// Use error handling: Proper error handling can prevent unexpected crashes and improve the stability of your code. Use try/catch blocks to handle errors and provide informative error messages.

// Test your code: Write tests to ensure your code works as expected and catches any bugs or errors. Use testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha to automate your tests.
